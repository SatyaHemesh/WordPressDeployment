Initializing the backend...
Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of kreuzwerker/docker from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed kreuzwerker/docker v3.0.2

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform       
apply" now.
